# TaskMasterAPI

## These are Steps for the week.

### Feature 1:
I created a create method to My API gateway while using a Lambda funtion.
To create a task you can use the following URL: 
Post:
https://8o88ocps78.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/tasks
The task has to be posted in Json format.

### Example 
{
"assignee": "Fabian",
"title":"Writing example",
"description": "making an example for a task post method"
}
